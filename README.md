JavaFX Graphical User Interface
I created a Surgery Control Panel using javaFX and methods.

The application comprises several regions representing controls for clocks (a real time and an elapsed time), room temperature, humidity and pressure, lighting control, and a medical gases display. Each area on screen comprises JavaFX nodes and controls, such as buttons, labels, text, image views and graphical shapes.
