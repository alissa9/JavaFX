JavaFX Graphical User Interface
I created a Surgery Control Panel using javaFX

The application comprises several regions representing controls for clocks (a real time and an elapsed time), room temperature, humidity and pressure, lighting control, and a medical gases display. Each area on screen comprises JavaFX nodes and controls, such as buttons, labels, text, image views and graphical shapes.
